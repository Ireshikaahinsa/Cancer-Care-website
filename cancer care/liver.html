              <h2 style="margin-left:300px;margin-right: 300px;font-size:23px;text-align: justify";>What is known as Liver?  </h2>
              <p style="margin-left:300px;margin-right: 300px;font-size:23px;text-align: justify";>The liver is a largest internal, meaty organ that’s on the right side of the belly of human body. It is around weighing about 3 pounds. The liver is reddish-brown in color and feels rubbery to the touch in real. Normally you can't feel the liver, because it's protected by the rib cage.
                The liver has two large sections. They are the right and the left lobes. The gallbladder is situated under the liver, accompanied by parts of the pancreas and intestines. The liver and these organs work together to digest, absorb, and process food in our body.
                The liver's main job is to filter the blood coming from the digestive tract, before transferring it to the rest of the body. The liver also detoxifies chemicals and metabolizes drugs in our coming blood. So, the liver secretes bile that ends up back in the intestines. It also makes proteins important for blood clotting and other functions. No one can live without a liver.</p>

<p style="margin-left:300px;margin-right: 300px;font-size:20px;text-align: justify";>Cancer starts when vigorous cells differ and grow out of control, forming a mass called a tumor like others. A tumor can be cancerous or benign. A cancerous tumor is malignant which is, it can grow and spread to other parts of the body. A benign tumor can grow but will not spread not as cancerous tumor. This section only provides information about cancer that begins in the liver. This is known as primary liver cancer. It is more common for cancer that started in another part of the body to spread to the liver. This is not liver cancer, but rather “metastatic cancer” of another organ. For example, pancreatic, colon, stomach, breast, lung, or other cancer that has spread to the liver is still named according to the organ in which it started. For more evidence about cancer that began in another part of the body and has spread to the liver. If you still facing trouble read about that specific cancer type. Symptoms generally do not appear until the cancer is advanced which is tough for patients. Major risk factors include excessive alcohol intake, hepatitis, and diabetes are main reasons for liver cancer. Sadly liver cancer has a low survival rate in this modern era too.
