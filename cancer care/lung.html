              <h2 style="margin-left:300px;margin-right: 300px;font-size:23px;text-align: justify";>What is known as Lungs?  </h2>
              <p style="margin-left:300px;margin-right: 300px;font-size:23px;text-align: justify";>The lungs are the main organs for breathing, and they are part of the respiratory system includes the nose, mouth etc. When a person inhales, the lungs absorb oxygen from the air and bring the oxygen into the bloodstream for delivery to the rest of the body. As the body’s cells use oxygen, they release carbon dioxide as we all know. The bloodstream carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs, and the carbon dioxide leaves the body when a person exhales like we studied in Science subject back in school days. Our Lungs look like two large, spongy cones. Each lung is made up of lobes. Left lung has two contain many different types of cells especially epithelial cells. Epithelial cells line the airways and make mucus, which lubricates and protects the lung. The lung also contains nerve cells, hormone-producing cells, blood cells, and structural or supporting cells. The lungs rest on the diaphragm, a thin muscle that helps with breathing. The lungs are covered by two layers of a thin sheet of tissue called the pleura, which is about as thick as plastic cling wrap. The inner layer is attached to the lungs, and the outer layer lines the chest wall and diaphragm. In between the two layers is the pleural cavity or pleural space. Pleural cavity normally contains a small amount of fluid. This fluid allows the two layers of pleura to slide over each other so the lungs move smoothly against the chest wall when you breathe.</p>

<p style="margin-left:300px;margin-right: 300px;font-size:20px;text-align: justify";>There are 2 main division of lung cancer. They are small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. This is shortly briefed as NSCLC. These 2 types are treated differently in medical science technology. NSCLC begins when healthy cells in the lung change and grow out of control, forming a mass called a tumor, a lesion, or a nodule and spreading. A lung tumor can start anywhere in the lung. A tumor can be cancerous or benign same as other cancer types. Once a benign lung tumor grows, it might shed cancer cells. These cells can be transferred away in blood or float away in the fluid known as lymph. Lymph that surrounds lung tissue. Lymph flows through tubes called lymphatic vessels which drain into collecting stations known lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are the tiny, bean-shaped organs that help fight infection in our body. They are situated in the lungs, the center of the chest, and everywhere in the body. The natural flow of lymph out of the lungs is toward the center of the chest which explains why lung cancer often spreads there first. When a cancer cell moves into a lymph node or to a different part of the body through the bloodstream which is known metastasis in medical science technology. Lung cancer is the uninhibited growth and spread of abnormal cells in one or both lungs in our body. These abnormal cells do not carry out the functions of normal lung cells and don’t develop into healthy lung tissue. As they grow and spread, the abnormal cells can form tumors and interfere with the functioning of the lung, which provides oxygen to the body by the blood.
