<p style="margin-left:150px;margin-right: 150px;font-size:20px;text-align: justify";>Research on the biology of cancer starts with the simplest of questions: What is and isn't normal? 
  To understand how cancer develops and progresses, researchers first need to investigate the biological differences between normal cells and cancer cells. This work focuses on the mechanisms that underlie fundamental processes such as cell growth, the transformation of normal cells to cancer cells, and the spread, or metastasis, of cancer cells.
  Knowledge gained from such studies deepens our understanding of cancer and produces insights that could lead to the development of new clinical interventions. For example, studies of cell signaling pathways in normal cells and cancer cells have contributed greatly to our knowledge about the disease, revealing molecular alterations that are shared among different types of cancer and pointing to possible strategies for treatment.
  The last few decades of basic research in cancer biology have created a broad base of knowledge that has been critical to progress against the disease. In fact, many advances in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer would not have occurred without the knowledge that has come from investigating basic questions about the biology of cancer.

<p style="margin-left:150px;margin-right: 150px;font-size:20px;text-align: justify";>The study of cancer genomes has revealed abnormalities in genes that drive the development and growth of many types of cancer. This knowledge has improved our understanding of the biology of cancer and led to new methods of diagnosing and treating the disease.
  For example, the discovery of cancer-causing genetic and epigenetic changes in tumors has enabled the development of therapies that target these changes as well as diagnostic tests that identify patients who may benefit from these therapies. One such targeted drug is vemurafenib (Zelboraf), which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011 for the treatment of some patients with melanoma who have a specific mutation in the BRAF gene as detected by an FDA-approved test.
  Over the past decade, large-scale research projects have begun to survey and catalog the genomic changes associated with a number of types of cancer. These efforts have revealed unexpected genetic similarities across different types of tumors. For instance, mutations in the HER2 gene (distinct from amplifications of this gene, for which therapies have been developed for breast, esophageal, and gastric cancers) have been found in a number of cancers, including breast, bladder, pancreatic, and ovarian. 
  Researchers have also shown that a given type of cancer, such as breast, lung, and stomach, may have several molecular subtypes. For some types of cancer, the existence of certain subtypes had not been known until researchers began to profile the genomes of tumor cells.
  The results of these projects illustrate the diverse landscape of genetic alterations in cancer and provide a foundation for understanding the molecular basis of this group of diseases.

</div>
<p style="margin-left:150px;margin-right: 150px;font-size:20px;text-align: justify";>Studying the causes of cancer helps researchers understand the process of carcinogenesis and can lead to new ways of preventing the disease.
  Research on the causes of cancer also creates opportunities to improve public health, not only by identifying genetic, environmental, and behavioral risk factors in populations, but also by providing data that regulatory agencies can use to set safety standards or to reduce exposure to toxins that are found to be associated with cancer. Findings from this area of research can also inform the development of clinical practice guidelines for physicians and advances such as safer computed tomography (CT) scans and risk-reducing surgeries.
  Studying the interactions between genetic factors, lifestyle factors, and environmental exposures could reveal previously unknown biological processes involved in cancer. Knowledge of cancer risk factors creates opportunities to develop risk prediction models for identifying individuals who may be at increased risk of certain cancers. And, for some cancers, individuals at increased risk may be able to take steps to reduce their risk.
  Many different approaches are used to identify potential causes of cancer. Genome analyses such as genome-wide association studies, exome sequencing, and whole-genome sequencing allow researchers to identify genetic changes that may be associated with cancer risk. Family studies can provide information by identifying genes that are responsible for familial cancers and that may yield insights into nonfamilial (sporadic) forms of the disease.
  Researchers also use a variety of epidemiological approaches—including cohort studies, case-control studies, exposure-assessment studies, family studies, and genomic studies—to identify possible causes of cancer and study the patterns of risk in large populations.
  Another approach, known as descriptive epidemiology, characterizes trends in cancer incidence and mortality within a given population, between populations over time, and in relation to overall patterns of exposure in populations to yield clues that may point researchers to cancer causes and risk factors.
